The kinematics of satellite galaxies moving in a dark matter halo are a direct probe of its underlying gravitational potential. Consequently, satellite kinematics constitute a powerful tool to determine the galaxy--halo connection from observations. By stacking the kinematics of a large number of satellite galaxies this potential can be unlocked even for central galaxies that on average only host a few satellite galaxies. Previously, such an analysis has been applied to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to constrain the average halo masses of central galaxies. Later studies using gravitational lensing confirmed most qualitative results based on satellite kinematics. However, a consistent offset of roughly a factor of 2 between the average halo masses derived from satellite kinematics and those from weak gravitational lensing has been found. In this work, we test the impact of various modeling assumptions on constraints derived from satellite kinematics. We discuss the potential of those systematic effects to explain the discrepancy between results based on kinematics and gravitational lensing. Furthermore, we develop an updated, more robust analysis to extract constraints on the galaxy--halo connection from satellite kinematics in spectroscopic galaxy surveys such as the SDSS. We test the accuracy of this approach using a large number of realistic mock catalogs. Finally, we apply this updated analysis to SDSS DR7 to get new constraints on the galaxy--halo connection from satellite kinematics.
